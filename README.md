# Overview

This program is designed to help people write their workouts for each day of the week
by using a random number generator to write the workouts and the amount of reps they 
should do per workout

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I'd like to make it so that you can save your workouts and use them again at a later date
* I'd like to make a much more pretty UI 
* I want to make the weight ranges more intuitive so that the actual weight being lifted is closer to what
* the user would lift.
